		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>My idea of creating a mixed ready-to-wear brand. The desired style is the oversize, we have as women like to wear their man's oversized t-shirt. It is in this spirit that I would like to orient this brand.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>Choosing to wear my brand is choosing and showing a lifestyle. Style is for me above all a way to show people around you who you are. It's messages, needs and activities that go through the choice of the creation worn. It is also choosing not to spend a lot of money on clothes.
